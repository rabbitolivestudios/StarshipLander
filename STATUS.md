## Project Snapshot

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| App | Starship Lander |
| Bundle ID | com.tboliveira.StarshipLander |
| Platform | iOS (iPhone), iOS 15.0+ |
| Tech | SwiftUI + SpriteKit + CoreMotion |
| Current Version | **v2.2.1 (Build 38) submitted for App Store review** for the live v2.2.0 Build 37 Campaign startup crash. |
| Version Status | **v2.2.1 Build 38 is waiting for App Store review.** Session 67 fixed the likely crash root cause: campaign attempt tracking saved a nested `[Int: Int]` dictionary into `UserDefaults`, which can terminate the app because property-list dictionaries require string keys. Session 68 restored local SSD Xcode verification, uploaded Build 38, updated App Store Connect hotfix metadata, attached the build, and submitted it for review. |
| Last Published | v2.2.0 (Build 37) — on App Store (approved/distributed 2026-05-03) |
| Developer | Thiago Borges de Oliveira / Rabbit Olive Studios |
| Team ID | 6XK6BNVURL |
| Repo | github.com/rabbitolivestudios/StarshipLander |

## What Is Done

These features are fully implemented, build-verified, and included in the current codebase:

**(Everything from v2.1.0 and prior — see previous STATUS.md entries)**

**v2.2.0 — New Features (code complete, local fixes simulator-verified):**

- **Daily Challenge System**: 75 rotating challenge templates with rich constraint types (target platform, max tilt, max V/H speed, min fuel, time limit). Deterministic `dayOfYear % 75` cycling in UTC so the same challenge is active worldwide. Auto-computed difficulty 1-5 stars based on planet gravity/hazards, constraint count/tightness, time pressure. Pre-challenge briefing screen (`DailyChallengeBriefingView`) showing objectives, planet info, difficulty, global today's best (from Game Center), local best, streak info, and blue star reward preview. Challenge evaluation with per-constraint pass/fail breakdown on game-over. Distinct challenge failure UX (orange warning icon, "LANDED — BUT CHALLENGE FAILED" message, sad trombone sound) when landing but missing challenge criteria. Countdown timer with time bonus scoring for timed challenges. Daily Challenge leaderboard on Game Center.
- **Blue Star Currency**: `BlueStarManager.swift` — singleton with UserDefaults persistence. Earn blue stars through: daily challenge completion (+1), 5-day streak bonus (+3), campaign star milestones (10→+10, 20→+50, 30→+150). Idempotent reward claiming. Displayed on menu and game-over screens.
- **Global Rank on Game-Over Screen**: Per-leaderboard rank displayed after each landing (`lastLeaderboardRank` in GameCenterManager). Fetches rank ~1s after score submission. Works for classic, campaign, and daily challenge modes.
- **Interstitial Ads**: `InterstitialAdManager.swift` — shows ad every 7th Retry/Next Level tap. Never blocks gameplay on ad failure. Test ID in DEBUG, production ID (`ca-app-pub-3801339388353505/8269147180`) in RELEASE. Video ads disabled in AdMob console (text/image only). Uses existing `topViewController()` for presentation.
- **Modernized Menu and Starship Art**: Sci-fi title typography (monospaced, wide tracking, gradient). Settings gear and How to Play icons in top-right bar (next to version label). Banner ad pinned via `.safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom)`. Settings moved to gear sheet. Blue star count on menu. Streak display. Default Starship art refreshed with stylized stainless body shading, black heat-shield tiles, flaps, engines, and landing legs while preserving gameplay collision dimensions.
- **How To Play Expanded**: Added Daily Challenge section (6 constraint types explained) and Blue Stars section (5 earning methods documented).
- **Elapsed Time Tracking**: `gameStartTime` in GameScene, `elapsedTime` in GameState. Used for time-limited daily challenges.

## What Is NOT Done

These are **not implemented**. Do not assume otherwise:

- ~~**Game Center integration**~~ — **PUBLISHED** in v2.1.0
- ~~**v2.2.0 submission**~~ — **APPROVED AND DISTRIBUTED** on 2026-05-03 with Build 37
- ~~**`daily_challenge` leaderboard in App Store Connect**~~ — **CREATED + RELEASED** on 2026-05-01
- **In-App Purchases (IAP)** — deferred (was planned for v2.2.0 Monetization, replaced by interstitial ads + blue stars)
- **iPad support** — iPhone only
- **Landscape orientation** — portrait only
- **Localization** — English only
- **UI tests (XCUITest)** — no automated UI tests
- ~~**CI/CD pipeline**~~ — **BASIC GITHUB ACTIONS CI ADDED** in Session 67 for cloud macOS build/test verification; release upload automation still not configured

## Current Phase / Focus

**Phase: Retention + Monetization (v2.2.1) — emergency campaign crash hotfix**

v2.2.0 adds three pillars: (1) Daily Challenge system with 75 templates, auto-computed difficulty, countdown timer, and blue star rewards for daily retention, (2) Interstitial ads every 7 attempts for monetization, (3) Global rank on game-over for competition visibility. Build 37 was approved/distributed by Apple on 2026-05-03, but live testing found the app closes when starting campaign gameplay on selected planets. v2.2.1 Build 38 is the emergency hotfix release for that live crash.

---

## Immediate Next Tasks (ordered)

1. Monitor v2.2.1 Build 38 review status until approved/distributed.
2. Verify the replacement App Store/TestFlight build on device as soon as Apple makes it available.
3. Confirm Campaign startup on Earth, Venus, and an early unlocked planet in the replacement build.
4. Resume v2.3 planning only after the live crash is resolved.

## Non-Negotiable Principles

- STATUS.md is the authoritative project snapshot. Chat logs are input, not truth.
- Every session must produce a chat summary in `Docs/chats/` — no exceptions.
- Documentation updates are mandatory in the same commit as code changes.
- No version bumps without explicit user approval.
- No new SDKs without documenting privacy impact first.
- Build must succeed before committing. No broken code on main.
- No mixing unrelated development phases in one commit.

---

## How to Resume Work

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` — full project guidelines and session checklist
2. Read `STATUS.md` (this file) — authoritative current state
3. Read `PROJECT_LOG.md` — latest session entry and backlog
4. Read the **project history summary** at the top of `PROJECT_LOG_ARCHIVE.md` — older session context
5. Read latest file in `Docs/chats/` — detailed context from last session
6. Run `git log --oneline -10` — verify recent commits
7. Ask the user what to work on
8. Define "done checklist" before writing code

## Known Risks / Watchouts

- **v2.2.0 Build 37 is the current live version** — approved/distributed 2026-05-03, but campaign startup is crashing in the live build
- **v2.2.1 Build 38 is submitted for review** — App Store Connect state `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`, submitted 2026-05-04T01:20:53Z
- **v2.1.1 submitted for review** — share card redesign + GC fix
- **Local Xcode restored on SSD** — Xcode 26.4.1 is installed at `/Volumes/SamsungSSD/Developer/Xcode/Xcode-26.4.1.app`; local tests passed with 96 tests, 0 failures
- **Apple object-storage instability** — seen during prior build upload attempts and one screenshot upload retry; final build and screenshots succeeded
- **ASC API key refreshed locally** — new Team API key is stored under `~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/` with chmod 600; do not commit it
- **`daily_challenge` leaderboard exists in ASC** — created and released on 2026-05-01
- **Physical iPhone unavailable for local install** — iPhone 16 TBO showed as offline during Session 64; simulator smoke passed
- **Blue star currency has no spending mechanism yet** — earn-only for now, spending TBD in future version
- **Premium skins are not implemented yet** — realistic/generated Starship art is a future store/unlock candidate, not current gameplay content
- **VPN blocks Game Center** — always disable VPN during GC testing
- **ASC draft deletion removes releases** — must re-run `--create-releases` if draft is deleted
- **TestFlight masks GC issues** — TestFlight can access draft GC resources, App Store builds cannot
- **Git HTTP/2 broken pipe** — large pushes require `git config http.version HTTP/1.1`
