# Changelog

All notable changes to the Starship Lander project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.1] — Build 38 Hotfix

### Fixed
- **Campaign startup crash**: Game Center campaign attempt tracking now persists `attemptsByLevel` with string keys before saving to `UserDefaults`. The live Build 37 campaign auto-start path could save a nested `[Int: Int]` dictionary, which is not property-list-safe and can terminate the app when the player begins a campaign run.
- **Fresh-scene reset flag leak**: New game scenes now consume stale `shouldReset` state during setup. This prevents the first input after launching a new Classic/Campaign/Daily run from immediately resetting the scene, and avoids double-counting the first campaign attempt.
- **Daily Challenge hazard parity**: Mercury heat shimmer and Io volcanic eruption effects now run in Daily Challenge as well as Campaign mode.
- **Heat particle cleanup**: Reset now removes the `heatParticles` scene action alongside the main heat shimmer action, preventing Mercury visual effects from leaking into later retries/levels.

### Added
- Regression coverage for Game Center attempt tracking persistence and reload from string-keyed `UserDefaults` data.
- GitHub Actions iOS CI workflow plus reusable `Scripts/ci_xcodebuild.sh` for cloud macOS build/test verification when local Xcode is unavailable.
- Local SSD Xcode workflow restored with Xcode 26.4.1 installed under `/Volumes/SamsungSSD/Developer/Xcode`.
- v2.2.1 App Store Connect distribution copy, review notes, Build 38 attachment, and review submission record.

## [2.1.1] — Build 33 (Phase: Community)

### Changed
- **Share Score Card Redesign**: Complete redesign of share card with two layout variants:
  - **Landing card**: Score hero, stars, mode/level, platform+band badge, compact colored stats row (V/H/Fuel with green/yellow/red band colors)
  - **Crash card**: Crash headline hero (from pool of 20), CRASH badge (red), "Cause: ..." diagnostic line with value and unit (m/s)
  - Stats values colored by band using `LandingThresholds` (same source of truth as HUD)
  - App Store footer on card image, App Store URL in share text payload
  - Share button enabled on both landing and crash game-over screens
  - `LandingMessages.shortCrashCause()`: Compact cause string for crash cards

### Fixed
- **Game Center Integration**: GC leaderboards and achievements were not visible on App Store builds (only worked on TestFlight). Root cause: resources were created via API but missing "release" resources (`gameCenterLeaderboardReleases` / `gameCenterAchievementReleases`) needed to attach them to an app version submission. Fixed by adding `--create-releases` flag to `setup_game_center.py` and uploading 10 achievement icons.

### Added
- **Achievement Icons**: 10 programmatically generated 1024x1024 PNG achievement icons (`Scripts/generate_achievement_icons.py`). Badge/emblem style with unique colors per achievement.

## [2.0.3] — Build 30 PUBLISHED (approved 2026-02-06)

### Changed
- **Scoring Rebalance (Session 48)**: Comprehensive scoring improvements to address low score feedback:
  - Soft Landing: 500→550 pts, Horizontal Precision: 400→450 pts (subtotal max 2000→2100)
  - Velocity scoring denominator changed from safe to hard threshold — smooth curve with HARD landing partial credit (no more zero-out cliff)
  - Fuel multiplier range: 1.0-2.0x → 1.0-2.2x
  - Fuel consumption reduced: thrust 0.30→0.27%/frame, rotation 0.08→0.07%/frame, accelerometer 0.04→0.035×tilt
  - **Tilt bands**: Tilt now uses SAFE/HARD/FAIL bands like speed (≤2.9° safe, ≤5.7° hard with partial credit, >5.7° crash). Doubles survivable tilt range. Rotation scoring uses hard tilt as denominator.
  - New theoretical max: 23,100 (was 20,000). Typical scores +15-30% across all scenarios.
- **Europa Cryogeysers (Session 47)**: Replaced ice slide crash mechanic (H.Speed > 20 = instant death) with cryogeyser eruptions — intermittent force-based ice/water plumes that push the rocket upward. 3 fixed geyser positions with staggered active/calm cycling (2-3s active, 3-5s calm), blue/white/cyan particle columns, subtle vent markers on surface. Ice shimmer and low platform friction preserved. Disruptive but survivable.
- **Speed Thresholds Tightened (Session 46)**: Made landings harder across all platforms:
  - Platform A: safe V 80→70, hard V 120→100, safe H 60→50, hard H 100→80 (~15% tighter)
  - Platform B: safe V 55→50, hard V 85→75, safe H 45→40, hard H 75→60 (~15% tighter)
  - Platform C: safe V 35→33, hard V 55→52, safe H 30→28, hard H 50→48 (~5% tighter)
- **Jupiter Difficulty Increase (Session 46)**: Wind now pushes left→right exclusively with stronger force (base 20.0), ambient wind during calm periods, gravity increased from -4.8 to -5.2
- **Titan Thrust Reduction (Session 46)**: Dense atmosphere now reduces thrust to 75% efficiency instead of applying drag damping (makes it harder, not easier)
- **Mercury Heat Shimmer Enhanced (Session 46)**: Increased thrust perturbation wobble, added rising heat distortion particle effect
- **All Celestial Bodies Fixed (Session 46)**: Astronomically-correct bodies visible from each landing location:
  - Moon → Earth, Mars → sunSmall, Titan → Saturn (with rings), Europa → Jupiter (with bands)
  - Earth → Moon (with craters), Venus → sunMedium, Mercury → sunLarge (with glow/corona)
  - Ganymede → Jupiter, Io → Jupiter, Jupiter → europaSmall
- **Earth Platform Movement (Session 46)**: Zone-based collision avoidance — Platform B stays in 5%-50% zone, Platform C stays in 55%-95% zone, eliminating startup collision
- **CENTER Badge Removed (Session 46)**: Flight Data panel CENTER row now shows value only without OK/HARD/FAIL badge

### Fixed
- **Menu Button Truncation (Session 46)**: "Menu" button on landing report no longer truncated on smaller screens
- ~~**Europa Ice Now Affects Gameplay (Session 46)**~~: Superseded by cryogeysers (Session 47)
- **Partial Platform Landing Detection (Session 46)**: Both rocket legs (47pt span) must be within platform bounds to land successfully — one leg hanging off now causes crash ("Missed the platform!")

### Changed
- **Flight Data Panel Redesign (Session 45)**: Complete rewrite of `FinalStatsView` with HUD-style design language:
  - SF Symbol icons per metric (rotate.right, arrow.down, arrow.left.arrow.right, fuelpump.fill, scope)
  - OK/HARD/FAIL colored badge pills (green/yellow/red) per metric based on thresholds
  - 3-color value system matching badges
  - Gray divider lines between rows
  - Centered header with sparkle decorations
  - "HARD LANDING" yellow badge / "RAPID UNSCHEDULED DISASSEMBLY" red badge at bottom
  - Band logic: tilt (safe/fail), V/H speed (uses LandingThresholds), fuel (>20%/>0%/0%), center (<20pt/<30pt/≥30pt)
- **Randomized Crash Headlines (Session 45)**: Static "CRASH!" replaced with pool of 20 randomized messages. SpaceX references ("RAPID UNSCHEDULED DISASSEMBLY", "LITHOBRAKING DETECTED"), space mission quotes ("HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM"), Kerbal vibes ("GRAVITY: 1 — PILOT: 0"), dry humor ("TASK FAILED SUCCESSFULLY"). Different message each crash.
- **Game-Over Overlay Restructure (Session 45)**: `GameOverView` moved from HUD VStack to ZStack root in `GameContainerView` for proper full-screen layering. Previously, the overlay was constrained within the HUD VStack causing buttons to be cut off and requiring scroll. See `Screenshots/v2.0.3-bugs/bug14_gameover_overlay_cutoff_buttons_hidden.jpeg` and `bug15_gameover_overlay_scrolled_buttons_visible.jpeg`.

### Fixed
- **High Score Sheet Not Appearing (Session 45)**: Race condition where `onAppear` fired before `gameState` properties propagated. Added `onChange` listeners for `gameState.score` and `gameState.landed` as fallback triggers. Previously the high score input was inline within the overlay, also requiring scroll — see `Screenshots/v2.0.3-bugs/bug16_highscore_inline_requires_scroll.jpeg`. Now presented as a modal sheet.

### Changed
- **Build Hygiene Improvements (Session 42)**:
  - `.gitignore` updated: added `*.p8`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.secret`, `.env`, `.env.*`, `.apple_id`, `*.ipa`, `*.dSYM`, `*.dSYM.zip` patterns
  - All `print()` statements wrapped in `#if DEBUG` guards (5 occurrences in `RocketLanderApp.swift` and `BannerAdView.swift`)
  - ATT request optimized: only calls `requestTrackingAuthorization` when status is `.notDetermined`
  - Player name TextField capped at 20 characters
  - Legacy `Podfile` deleted (project uses SPM)

### Fixed
- **GameOverView Text Truncation**: Landing success messages and crash diagnostic messages were truncated on device. Added `.multilineTextAlignment(.center)` + `.fixedSize(horizontal: false, vertical: true)` to landing message, crash primary diagnostic, and crash secondary diagnostic. Wrapped GameOverView body in ScrollView for vertical overflow protection on tall content (landing + new high score scenario).
- **Menu Ad Banner Clipping (Improved)**: Previous fix (16pt bottom padding) was insufficient — banner was still clipped by home indicator. Restructured MenuView: moved `BannerAdContainer()` outside ScrollView into a `VStack(spacing: 0)` wrapper, pinning the ad at the bottom where SwiftUI's safe area layout naturally keeps it above the home indicator. Verified on iPhone 16 Pro simulator.
- **Menu Layout Overflow**: Menu content (~700pt) overflowed on most iPhones, with the banner ad covering the bottom section. Replaced the inline "HOW TO PLAY" section with a "How to Play >" text button that opens a rich info sheet (`HowToPlayView`). Added 60pt bottom padding to ScrollView content to clear the banner ad. Saves ~79pt of vertical space — menu now fits without scrolling on iPhone 12 mini and larger.

### Added
- **How to Play Info Sheet** (`HowToPlayView.swift`): A scrollable sheet accessible from the menu with 5 sections: Controls (adapts to button/accelerometer setting), Landing Platforms (table with pad/name/width/multiplier/stars), Speed Bands (SAFE/HARD/FAIL explanation + per-platform threshold table), Scoring (all 6 components, fuel/platform multipliers, max 20,000), Campaign (all 10 levels with gravity and special mechanic). Dark theme matching the app, orange accent headers.

### Changed
- **Code Housekeeping (Session 37)**: Removed dead code, fixed imports, deleted stale file. No behavior changes. 9 files changed, 284 deletions.
  - Removed: `leftFlame`/`rightFlame` (GameScene), `crashMessage()`/`crashMessages`/`crashNudges` (LandingMessages), `crashNudge` (GameState), `getTopScore()` (HighScoreManager), `Triangle` shape (ShapeViews), unused `CrashCause` enum cases (`terrainCollision`, `outOfBounds`)
  - Fixed imports: `import SwiftUI` → `import Foundation` + `import Combine` in model files; removed unused `import SpriteKit` from ContentView
  - Deleted stale `SETUP.txt`
  - Updated tests to match removals (90 → 89 tests)

### Added
- **Unit Tests**: 89 XCTest cases across 10 test files covering core game logic
  - ScoringTests: formula verification, HARD penalty, constraint tests, realistic scenarios (16 tests)
  - HighScoreManagerTests: persistence, sorting, backward-compat decoding (9 tests)
  - CampaignStateTests: level unlock, stars, score tracking, persistence (10 tests)
  - LevelDefinitionTests: level data integrity, gravity/thrust progression (8 tests)
  - LandingMessagesTests: message selection logic, pool verification (4 tests)
  - GameStateTests: initial values, reset, accelerometer persistence (3 tests)
  - LandingPlatformTests: multipliers, stars, widths, positions (5 tests)
  - CrashDiagnosticTests: crash classification, precedence, determinism (14 tests)
  - LandingEvaluationTests: per-platform speed band classification, boundaries, composites (20 tests)
  - ScoringHelper: test-only scoring formula replica
- **Per-Platform Speed Bands + Threshold Enforcement**: `LandingThresholds.swift` — single source of truth for SAFE/HARD/FAIL speed thresholds per platform. Platform A (V≤80/H≤60 safe), B (V≤55/H≤45), C (V≤35/H≤30). `checkLanding()` rewritten to use `LandingThresholds.evaluate()` with post-thrust tracked velocities — speed now affects landing success for the first time (exceeding FAIL threshold = crash). HUD updated to show Platform C safe values (V<35, H<30). Old hardcoded V<40/H<25 constants removed.
- **Perfect Landing Score Analysis**: `Scripts/calculate_perfect_scores.py` — frame-by-frame physics simulation computing maximum achievable scores for all 33 level/platform combinations. Models exact SpriteKit physics (gravity, thrust, fuel, screen wrapping, campaign reentry state). Best: Classic C = 14,504 via left screen wrap.

### Changed
- **Removed explicit HARD landing penalty**: The 0.4× subtotal multiplier for HARD landings has been removed. Superseded by smooth curve scoring in Session 48 — velocity components now use hard threshold as denominator, giving HARD landings partial credit.
- **Scoring uses per-platform denominators**: Velocity scoring components use platform-specific hard thresholds as denominators, meaning harder platforms have tighter scoring curves. HARD landings get meaningful partial credit instead of zeroing out.

---

## [2.0.3] - 2026-02-01 (Phase: Campaign Engagement)

### Added
- **Fixed Reentry Start State (Campaign Only)**: Campaign ships spawn with a deterministic 6.9° left tilt and 15 pts/s rightward drift, preventing trivial "hold thrust" strategy. Classic mode unchanged.
- **HUD Tilt Angle Display**: Real-time tilt indicator in degrees with directional color coding (cyan=left, orange=right, green=safe). Includes direction letter (L/R) when tilted beyond safe threshold.
- **Final Stats Panel**: Flight data (tilt, vertical speed, horizontal speed, fuel, center distance) frozen at moment of landing/crash and displayed on game over screen in both modes.
- **Deterministic Crash Messages**: Cause-based crash feedback tied to actual failure values, replacing random crash messages. Priority order: tilt > vertical speed > horizontal speed > approach speed. Same crash always produces the same message.
- **CrashDiagnostic Unit Tests**: 14 new tests verifying crash classification, precedence ordering, secondary hints, determinism (100x repeat), and edge cases.

### Changed
- **Perfect Score Simulation**: Updated `Scripts/calculate_perfect_scores.py` to model campaign reentry state (initial tilt + drift). Campaign scores drop <1% due to tilt correction fuel cost (~0.24%). Best unchanged: Classic C = 12,132.

### Fixed
- **HUD Tilt Truncation**: Tilt value was truncated with ellipsis ("12...L" instead of "12.8° L") due to `minimumScaleFactor` shrinking text. Fixed with `fixedSize()` and widened HUD from 150pt to 170pt.
- **Post-Collision Zeroed Velocities**: Final stats showed V.Speed=0 on crash because SpriteKit zeroes velocities during collision resolution. Fixed with pre-contact velocity tracking in the update loop (`lastTrackedVerticalSpeed`, `lastTrackedHorizontalSpeed`, `lastTrackedTilt`).
- **HUD vs Flight Data Mismatch**: HUD showed live values while Flight Data showed frozen snapshot, causing inconsistent displays on game-over screen. HUD now reads from `final*` values when `gameOver` is true.
- **Visual Start State Mismatch**: Campaign ships appeared upright at spawn despite having a reentry tilt. Fixed by applying `rocket.zRotation` in `setupScene()` after rocket creation.
- **Fuel Display Rounding**: HUD fuel used `Int()` (truncation) while Flight Data used `"%.0f"` (rounding), causing 99% vs 100% discrepancy for the same value. Both now use `"%.0f"` rounding.
- **Signed Tilt Preservation**: `finalTiltAngle` changed from absolute to signed value to preserve L/R direction for HUD display on game-over. `abs()` applied where needed (Flight Data, crash diagnostics).
- **Landing Threshold Using Post-Collision Velocity**: `checkLanding()` read velocity from physics body after SpriteKit collision resolution absorbed impact energy, allowing landings at V.Speed=71 to pass the V<50 threshold. Now uses pre-contact tracked values for threshold checks — same source as HUD, Flight Data, and crash diagnostics.

### Known Issues (Build 19)
- **⚠️ CRITICAL: Impossible to land on device.** Pre-contact tracked values are captured before thrust application in `update()`, making them systematically higher than actual post-thrust velocity. Landing threshold check rejects valid landings.
- **⚠️ CRITICAL: Velocity thresholds were dead code since initial commit.** SpriteKit zeros velocities during collision resolution before `didBegin(contact:)`. The V<40 and H<25 checks always saw V≈0 — speed never affected landing success in any build through Build 18. Build 19 is the first build to enforce speed. See `Docs/DIAGNOSTIC_velocity_thresholds.md`.
- **HUD threshold mismatch since creation.** HUD shows V<50 H<30 but actual GameScene thresholds are V<40 H<25. Created wrong in commit `fede844`, never caught because both display and threshold check were "wrong" in compatible ways.
- **Scoring was inflated.** All prior scores used near-zero post-collision velocities for speed components, producing near-maximum speed scores. Enforcement would lower achievable scores.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-01-31 (Phase: Campaign Polish) — SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **Scoring Rebalance**: Redistributed score components to reward center precision more
  - Soft Landing: 700 → 500 points
  - Platform Center: 350 → 600 points
  - Approach Control: 200 → 150 points
  - Fuel multiplier cap: 2.5x → 2.0x
  - New max theoretical score: 20,000 (was 25,000)
- **Proportional Thrust Vectoring**: Replaced binary RCS lateral assist with smooth proportional correction
  - Lateral force scales with tilt angle via sin(rotation) × 0.15 factor
  - Only active while thrusting (no free lateral assist)
- **Venus (Level 6)**: Vertical updrafts replace horizontal turbulence
  - Wind particles now move vertically instead of horizontally
  - Description: "Vertical updrafts disrupt your descent."
  - Mechanic display name: "Vertical Updrafts"
- **Jupiter (Level 10)**: Sudden gusts with calm windows replace smooth sine-wave wind
  - 2-4 second calm periods with light residual wind
  - Followed by 1.5-2.5 second sharp directional gusts
  - Description: "Sudden gusts between calm windows."
- **Mercury (Level 7)**: Heat shimmer now disrupts thrust control
  - Random velocity perturbation applied when thrusting
  - Description: "Heat shimmer disrupts thrust control."
- **Io (Level 9)**: Volcanic eruption particles are now deadly
  - Eruption particles have physics bodies (groundCategory) — contact crashes the rocket
  - Physics bodies removed before fade-out so fading particles are safe
  - Description: "Volcanic debris is deadly — time it."

### Added
- **Leaderboard Star Metadata**: High score entries now store star rating
  - HighScoreEntry gains backward-compatible `stars` field (defaults to 0 for old data)
  - Small star icons displayed between name and score in leaderboard rows
  - Stars passed through from both CampaignState.completedLevel and classic mode saveScore

### Fixed
- **Classic mode star rating not saved**: Classic mode high scores now correctly store the star rating (platform A=1, B=2, C=3) — previously always saved as 0
- **Classic mode star rating not displayed**: Classic section in leaderboard view and menu TOP PILOTS now pass stars to scoreRow — previously only campaign rows showed stars

---

## [2.2.0] - Build 37 Submitted (Phase: Retention + Monetization)

### Release Prep (Build 37 — App Store review submission complete)
- Build number bumped to 37 for the replacement v2.2.0 upload.
- `daily_challenge` added to `Scripts/setup_game_center.py` and created/released in App Store Connect with en-US localization.
- Full simulator test suite passed: 94 tests, 0 failures on iPhone 17 Pro simulator / iOS 26.4.
- Simulator release smoke screenshots captured for menu, Daily Challenge briefing/gameplay, and campaign gameplay.
- Archive succeeded and local App Store IPA export succeeded at `build/export-build37-local/RocketLander.ipa`.
- App Store Connect agreements are active and API access was restored with a new Team API key stored outside the repo.
- Build 37 uploaded through Xcode Organizer and is VALID in App Store Connect.
- v2.2.0 App Store version created; Build 37 attached.
- ASO metadata, review notes, and five 1284x2778 App Store screenshots uploaded.
- v2.2.0 review submission created through App Store Connect API and entered `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW` on 2026-05-01.

### Fixed (Build 37 local)
- **Campaign Progress Decoupled from High-Score Sheet**: Campaign stars, level unlocks, personal best scores, and blue star milestone rewards are now recorded immediately on successful campaign landing. Entering a name only affects the named top-3 leaderboard, so skipping the sheet no longer loses progress.
- **Campaign Attempt Tracking**: Campaign attempts are now recorded from the normal auto-start path, restoring first-attempt achievement logic.
- **Earth Moving Platform Scoring**: Partial-landing checks, final center distance, and center precision scoring now use the contacted platform node's live position instead of static platform fractions.
- **Daily Challenge Score Isolation**: Failed Daily Challenge landings no longer open the high-score sheet or save into Classic scores. Successful new daily bests still prompt for a name and update the daily local best name.
- **Blue Star Reward Display**: Game-over reward text now uses the actual reward result returned by `BlueStarManager`, preventing repeat same-day completions from displaying a reward that was not granted.
- **Worldwide Daily Challenge Date**: Daily Challenge rotation, local best keys, and blue star streak dates now use UTC day boundaries so the same challenge is active worldwide.

### Changed (Build 37 local)
- **Default Starship Art Refresh**: Updated the menu and SpriteKit gameplay Starship renderers with a more recognizable, game-styled Starship silhouette: stainless body shading, black heat-shield tile strip, four dark flaps with bevels, engine skirt detail, three Raptor-style bells, landing legs, and a cleaner flame. Physics body dimensions are unchanged.

### Fixed (Build 36 — Menu layout redesign)
- **Menu Layout Redesign**: Settings gear and help icons moved from bottom footer to top-right bar (next to version label). Eliminated footer HStack entirely. Banner ad uses `.safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom)` so SwiftUI reserves space automatically — no more overlap. Campaign button fully visible.

### Fixed (Build 35 — TestFlight bug fixes)
- ~~**Menu Layout Overlap**: Footer toolbar moved outside ScrollView~~ — superseded by Build 36 redesign above.
- **Interstitial Ad Frequency**: Reduced from every 3rd to every 7th Retry/Next Level tap. Previous cadence was too aggressive for short game sessions.
- **Interstitial Ad Duration**: Disabled video ad format in AdMob console — text/image/rich media only. Video ads (15-30s) were too long.
- **Multi-Touch Thrust Stuck**: Pressing thrust with one finger then tapping with a second finger caused thrust to get stuck active. Replaced `DragGesture` with `onLongPressGesture(pressing:)` which correctly tracks a single touch lifecycle. Same fix applied to rotation buttons.

### Added
- **Daily Challenge System**: A new challenge every UTC day, the same for all players worldwide. 75 rotating templates with rich constraint types:
  - 6 constraint types: target platform, max tilt, max vertical speed, max horizontal speed, min fuel, time limit
  - Challenges combine multiple constraints and rotate across all 10 planets
  - Auto-computed difficulty (1-5 stars) based on planet gravity/hazards, constraint count/tightness, platform requirement, and time pressure (planet-aware scoring)
  - Deterministic cycling via UTC `dayOfYear % 75` — same challenge worldwide each day
  - Pre-challenge briefing screen (`DailyChallengeBriefingView`) with: objectives, planet info, difficulty stars, global today's best (from GC), local best, streak info, blue star reward preview
  - Per-constraint pass/fail breakdown on game-over screen with actual values
  - Countdown timer for timed challenges with time bonus scoring
  - Challenge failure UX: distinct from crash — orange warning icon, "LANDED — BUT CHALLENGE FAILED" message, sad trombone sound (`challenge_fail.wav`)
  - Daily Challenge leaderboard on Game Center (`daily_challenge`)
  - `DailyChallenge.evaluate()` and `evaluateDetailed()` for constraint checking
- **Blue Star Currency** (`BlueStarManager.swift`): Special currency earned through skill and dedication
  - Daily challenge completion: +1 blue star
  - 5-day streak bonus: +3 blue stars
  - Campaign star milestones: 10 stars → +10 blue, 20 stars → +50 blue, 30 stars → +150 blue
  - Singleton with UserDefaults persistence, idempotent reward claiming
  - Displayed on menu (next to campaign stars) and game-over screens
- **Interstitial Ads** (`InterstitialAdManager.swift`): Revenue diversification beyond banners
  - Shows interstitial every 7th Retry/Next Level tap
  - Never blocks gameplay — silently skips on ad load failure
  - Test ID in DEBUG, production ID in RELEASE (`ca-app-pub-3801339388353505/8269147180`)
  - Uses existing `topViewController()` for presentation
- **Global Rank on Game-Over**: Per-leaderboard rank displayed ~1-2s after each landing
  - `lastLeaderboardRank` published property in GameCenterManager
  - `fetchLeaderboardRank(leaderboardID:)` called after score submission with 1s delay
  - Works for classic, campaign, and daily challenge modes
  - `clearLastLeaderboardRank()` prevents stale rank carryover between games
- **Elapsed Time Tracking**: `gameStartTime` in GameScene, `elapsedTime` in GameState. Used for time-limited daily challenges. Timer starts when `hasStarted` flips to true in update loop.

### Changed
- **Menu Modernized**: Sci-fi title typography (`.monospaced` with wide tracking and gradients), footer toolbar row (Settings | How to Play | version) replacing lone gear icon and separate version overlay. Settings moved to bottom sheet via gear icon. Blue star count displayed next to campaign stars. Streak counter shown below play buttons.
- **How To Play Expanded**: Two new sections — Daily Challenge (explains 6 constraint types with teal icons) and Blue Stars (explains 5 earning methods with milestone details)
- **Daily Challenge button**: Teal-colored button on menu between Classic and Campaign. Opens briefing screen instead of launching directly.
- **GameState**: Added `.dailyChallenge` game mode, `dailyChallengeTargetPlatform`, `dailyChallengeSuccess`, `elapsedTime` properties
- **GameScene**: Daily challenge mode loads level physics/hazards, evaluates constraints on landing, triggers blue star rewards on success
- **GameScene+Setup**: Daily challenge uses same planet rendering as campaign mode
- **GameCenterManager**: Added `submitDailyChallengeScore()`, `fetchDailyTopEntry()`, `fetchLeaderboardRank()`, `clearLastLeaderboardRank()`
- **GameOverView**: Constraint breakdown display, blue star reward display, campaign milestone display, interstitial ad trigger on Retry/Next Level
- **GameContainerView**: Passes `BlueStarManager.shared` to GameOverView
- **BannerAdView**: Added interstitial ad unit ID to `AdConfig` (production ID configured)
- **Fonts**: Added Orbitron font family for timer and challenge UI elements
- **GameScene+Sound**: Added `playChallengeFailSound()` for sad trombone on challenge failure
- **Scripts/generate_sounds.py**: Added `generate_challenge_fail()` — 16-bit sad trombone with vibrato

### Privacy Impact
- No new SDKs — uses existing Google Mobile Ads SDK for interstitial ads
- No new data collection — interstitial ads use same AdMob framework already declared
- No ATT changes — existing prompt covers all ad formats
- No new App Privacy declarations needed

---

## [2.1.0] - Build 32 PUBLISHED (approved 2026-02-06) — (Phase: Community)

### Added
- **Game Center Leaderboards**: 12 leaderboards (1 classic + 10 campaign + 1 galaxy_rank aggregate)
  - `GameCenterManager.swift`: ObservableObject + singleton pattern
  - Automatic authentication on launch with graceful fallback (GC features hidden when not signed in)
  - Fire-and-forget score submission after each successful landing via `GKLeaderboard.submitScore()`
  - Galaxy Rank = sum of best scores across all 10 campaign levels, submitted to aggregate leaderboard
  - Galaxy Rank displayed on menu (badge), campaign screen (explanation), and leaderboard screen (header)
  - GKAccessPoint on menu for native Game Center dashboard access
  - "View Global Rankings" button in LeaderboardView opens `GKGameCenterViewController`
- **Game Center Achievements**: 10 achievements tracking player progression and skill
  - Eagle Has Landed (any SAFE landing), Precision Landing (SAFE on B), Elite Landing (SAFE on C)
  - Fuel Master (≥65% fuel), Precision Pilot (SAFE C with ≤2°tilt, campaign), Triple Elite (SAFE C on 3+ campaign levels)
  - Planet Conquered (3 stars on a campaign level), First Try Perfection (SAFE C first attempt, campaign)
  - Solar System Elite (30 total stars), Master Lander (SAFE C on all 10 campaign levels)
  - Persistent tracking: `safePlatformCLevels` (Set<Int>) and `attemptsByLevel` ([Int:Int]) saved to UserDefaults
  - Idempotent unlocking — safe to report multiple times, `showsCompletionBanner = true`
- **Share Score Card**: Generate and share landing/crash results as an image
  - `ShareScoreCardView.swift`: 320pt dark gradient card with two variants:
    - **Landing card**: Score hero, stars, mode/level, platform+band badge, compact colored stats row (V/H/Fuel with green/yellow/red band colors)
    - **Crash card**: Crash headline hero (from pool of 20), CRASH badge (red), "Cause: ..." diagnostic line with value and unit
  - `ShareHelper.renderScoreCard()`: ImageRenderer (iOS 16+) with UIHostingController snapshot fallback (iOS 15)
  - `ShareHelper.shareImage()`: Native share sheet with image + text payload containing App Store URL
  - `LandingMessages.shortCrashCause()`: Compact cause string for crash cards (same priority logic as full diagnostics)
  - Share button on game-over screen (both landing and crash)
  - "Starship Lander on the App Store" footer on card image

### Fixed
- **Game Center Auth Completion**: `authenticateHandler`'s `viewController` was silently dropped, preventing per-app GC auth on devices requiring the sign-in dialog. Now presented on the topmost view controller. Without this fix, `GKGameCenterViewController` showed "Sign in to Game Center" even when the device had a Game Center account.
- **GKGameCenterViewController Presentation**: Previously presented from root VC which could fail silently in SwiftUI's presentation stack. Now walks the VC chain to find the topmost presented controller.

### Changed
- **Xcode capabilities**: Added Game Center entitlement (`RocketLander.entitlements`)
- **GameScene**: Added `campaignState` parameter, `recordAttempt()` call in `startGame()`, GC score submission + achievement check in `successfulLanding()`
- **GameContainerView**: Passes `campaignState` and `gameCenterManager` through to GameScene
- **ContentView/MenuView**: Galaxy Rank badge, GKAccessPoint management, `fetchGalaxyRank()` on appear
- **LeaderboardView**: Galaxy Rank header, "View Global Rankings" button, `GKDismissHandler`
- **LevelSelectView**: Galaxy Rank explanation section after level grid
- **App Privacy**: Added "Gameplay Content" declaration for Game Center

---

## [2.0.1] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **Dedicated Leaderboard Screen**: Tap "TOP PILOTS" on main menu to view all high scores
  - Classic Mode top-3 scores section
  - Campaign per-level top-3 scores for all 10 levels
  - Locked levels shown grayed out with lock icon
  - Gold/silver/bronze rank colors for top-3 positions

### Fixed
- **Accelerometer toggle not affecting gameplay**: MenuView used a separate `@AppStorage` binding that didn't sync with `GameState`. Toggle now binds directly to `gameState.useAccelerometer` so controls and game scene react immediately.

### Changed
- **Version number relocated**: Moved from bottom of scroll content to fixed top-right overlay on menu screen, ensuring it's always visible regardless of scroll position
- **TOP PILOTS section is now tappable**: Acts as entry point to the full leaderboard with "View All >" hint text

  - Level select grid UI with lock/unlock, star count, best scores

- **Per-Level Thrust Scaling**: Each planet has a unique engine thrust feel
  - Thrust ranges from 8.0 (Moon, floaty) to 18.5 (Jupiter, powerful but tight margin)
  - Thrust-to-gravity ratio decreases progressively: 5.0x (Moon) → 3.8x (Jupiter)

- **Lateral Assist (RCS Thrusters)**: When tilted >5°, small horizontal nudge in tilt direction

- **Per-Level High Scores (Campaign)**: Campaign mode tracks top-3 scores per level/planet separately from classic mode's global leaderboard

- **Level Name HUD**: Planet/level name displayed at top center during campaign gameplay

- **Level Details on Menu**: Level select cards show gravity (m/s²) and special mechanic for unlocked levels

- **Ganymede Deep Craters**: Rock pillar obstacles and raised terrain edges create crater hazards
  - Three jagged rock pillars with physics bodies (left edge, between B-C, right edge)
  - Terrain walls ramp up to 350px at screen edges for crater bowl effect
  - Terrain edge-chain physics body — hitting terrain or rocks crashes the rocket
  - Makes Ganymede visually and mechanically distinct from other levels

- **Astronaut Easter Egg High Scores**: Default leaderboard entries on first launch
  - Classic mode: "Elon" at 1000 points (SpaceX reference)
  - Campaign: astronaut/scientist names relevant to each planet (Armstrong, Aldrin, Huygens, etc.)

  - Formula: `subtotal × fuelMultiplier × platformMultiplier`
  - Max theoretical: 2000 × 2.5 × 5 = 25,000 points
- **Lateral Control**: Increased `rotationPower` from 0.025 to 0.04
- **Angular Damping**: Reduced from 1.0 to 0.7 for more responsive rotation
- **Rocket Start Position**: Now starts upper-left (x=15%, near top)
- **Menu Screen**: Two launch buttons — "Classic Mode" (orange) and "Campaign" (blue/purple)
- **Game Over Screen**: Shows star rating, platform info, "Next Level" button in campaign

### Architecture
- **File splitting**: Split 2 monolithic files (~900 lines each) into 21 organized files
  - `Models/`: GameState, HighScoreManager, LandingPlatform, LandingMessages, LevelDefinition, CampaignState
  - `Views/`: GameContainerView, GameOverView, HUDViews, ControlViews, ShapeViews, LevelSelectView
  - `Haptics/`: HapticManager
  - `GameScene+Setup.swift`, `GameScene+Effects.swift`, `GameScene+Sound.swift`, `GameScene+Scoring.swift`
